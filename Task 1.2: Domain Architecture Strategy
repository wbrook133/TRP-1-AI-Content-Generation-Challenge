### 1.2 OpenClaw & The Agent Social Network

**Concept Overview:**

OpenClaw represents a paradigm shift from human-centric social networks to **agent-to-agent communication networks**. Key principles:

1. **Agent Identity**
   - Each AI agent has a unique identifier
   - Reputation systems track agent reliability
   - Capability declarations (what the agent can do)

2. **Discovery Mechanisms**
   - Agents advertise their capabilities
   - Other agents discover and connect
   - Marketplace for agent services

3. **Communication Protocols**
   - Standardized message formats
   - Request/response patterns
   - Asynchronous task delegation

4. **Trust & Verification**
   - Cryptographic signatures
   - Proof of work/capability
   - Reputation scoring

**How Project Chimera Fits:**

Currently, Project Chimera is a **single-agent system** focused on content generation. To evolve into the Agent Social Network paradigm, it would need:

1. **Agent Identity Layer**
   ```python
   class ChimeraAgent:
       agent_id: str  # Unique identifier
       capabilities: List[str]  # ["music_generation", "video_generation", "image_generation"]
       reputation_score: float
       public_key: str  # For verification
   ```

2. **Capability Advertisement**
   ```python
   # Advertise what we can do
   capabilities = {
       "music": {
           "providers": ["lyria", "minimax"],
           "features": ["instrumental", "vocals", "style_transfer"],
           "latency": "30s - 15min",
           "cost": "$0.10 - $2.00 per generation"
       },
       "video": {
           "providers": ["veo", "kling"],
           "features": ["text2video", "image2video"],
           "latency": "30s - 14min"
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Inter-Agent Communication**
   - Other agents could request content generation
   - Chimera could delegate tasks to specialized agents
   - Example: A marketing agent requests a promotional video

---

### 1.3 MoltBook: Social Media for Bots

**Core Concept:**

MoltBook is a social network designed specifically for AI agents, not humans. Key features:

1. **Agent Profiles**
   - Skills and capabilities
   - Past work portfolio
   - Performance metrics

2. **Agent Interactions**
   - Agents "follow" other agents
   - Agents collaborate on complex tasks
   - Agents share resources and knowledge

3. **Reputation Economy**
   - Successful collaborations increase reputation
   - Failed tasks decrease reputation
   - Reputation affects discoverability

**Implications for Project Chimera:**

1. **Content Portfolio**
   - Every generation could be logged as a portfolio item
   - Quality metrics tracked (user satisfaction, technical quality)
   - Showcase best work to attract more requests

2. **Collaboration Opportunities**
   - Partner with a lyrics-writing agent
   - Collaborate with a video editing agent
   - Work with a distribution agent (YouTube upload)

3. **Specialization vs. Generalization**
   - Should Chimera be a generalist (music + video + images)?
   - Or specialize in one domain for higher quality?
   - Trade-offs in the agent marketplace

# src/ai_content/agent/discovery.py
class ServiceDiscovery:
    """Advertise Chimera's capabilities to the agent network"""
    
    async def advertise(self):
        """Broadcast capabilities to discovery service"""
        capabilities = {
            "music": {
                "providers": ["lyria", "minimax"],
                "latency_range": "30s-15min",
                "quality_score": 0.92,
                "cost_range": "$0.10-$2.00"
            },
            "video": {
                "providers": ["veo", "kling"],
                "latency_range": "30s-14min",
                "quality_score": 0.88
            }
        }
        await discovery_service.register(self.identity, capabilities)
```

**Phase 4: Autonomous Operation (Months 10-12)**

Enable Chimera to operate without human intervention:
```python
# src/ai_content/agent/autonomous.py
class AutonomousAgent:
    """Fully autonomous content generation agent"""
    
    async def handle_request(self, request: AgentMessage):
        """Process requests from other agents"""
        # Validate request
        if not self.can_fulfill(request):
            return self.create_rejection(request)
        
        # Estimate cost and time
        estimate = self.estimate_job(request)
        
        # Auto-approve if within budget
        if estimate.cost < self.budget_threshold:
            result = await self.execute_generation(request)
            return self.create_response(result)
        
        # Otherwise, request human approval
        return self.request_approval(request, estimate)
```
